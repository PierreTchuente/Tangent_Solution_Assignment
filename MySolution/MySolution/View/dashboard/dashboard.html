<h1>Anibal Family History </h1>

<p>
    Historically, surnames evolved as a way to sort people into groups - by occupation, place of origin, clan affiliation, patronage, parentage, adoption, and even physical characteristics (like red hair). Many of the modern surnames in the dictionary can
    be traced back to Britain and Ireland. An unusually short lifespan might indicate that your Anibal ancestors lived in harsh conditions. A short lifespan might also indicate health problems that were once prevalent in your family. The SSDI
    is a searchable database of more than 70 million names. You can find birthdates, death dates, addresses and more.
